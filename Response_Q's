What did you learn?

  Basically I learned how to solve a piramix duo, however it gave me a much better understanding of algorithms.
Thanks to the piramix I see puzzles differently, with more of a I have to get this without doing this. I feel
as this style of thinking is very applicable to real world problems. It also gave a good sense of working under 
preassure.  Although through sports I experience a sense of stress, however working with your brain in the sense 
of solving puzzles feels much different.
  
What did you like?

  I liked how the puzzle was basic, made you feel good about yourself when solved, but it still gave you a good
sense of algorithms and solving puzzles.
